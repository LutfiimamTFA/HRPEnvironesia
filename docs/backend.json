    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to provide a secure and scalable foundation for the HRP Starter Kit application. It emphasizes authorization independence, clarity, and adherence to Firestore best practices.\n\nThe design leverages path-based ownership for user profiles, ensuring that only the user (or a super_admin) can access their data.  This is achieved by placing user documents at `/users/{userId}`. This structure inherently provides authorization independence; security rules can validate `request.auth.uid` against the `{userId}` path segment without needing to perform costly and brittle `get()` operations to check ownership.\n\nThe application requirements include a seeding process that creates initial user accounts with specific roles.  The `users/{userId}` collection stores user profiles (fullName, email, role, isActive, createdAt) and facilitates role-based access control. The `super_admin` role has read/write access to all collections, which is achieved in security rules by checking for the existence of a document in a dedicated `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.\n\nQAPs (Rules Are Not Filters): List operations are inherently safe due to the structure.  A regular user can only read their own document in `users/{userId}`, so listing the entire collection would return no documents (without super_admin privileges).  The super_admin role, indicated by membership in `/roles_admin/{userId}`, grants broad access and bypasses the filtering constraints imposed on other users.\n\nAuthorization Independence: Achieved by storing all necessary authorization information directly within the user document at `/users/{userId}` (specifically, the `role` field) and leveraging path-based ownership. The super admin role is checked for via existence of a document, avoiding document `get()` calls.\n\n"
